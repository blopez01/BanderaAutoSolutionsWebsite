        question: "I got into an accident. What do I need to do?",
        answer: "First, give us a call or send us an email with information regarding the accident. We're going to need your name, number, vehicle make and model, and your insurance contact information. Once we have those items we can start the repair process."
    },
    {
        question: "How does it work?",
        answer: "After contacting your insurance provider, we handle the rest. You'll need to bring your vehicle to our shop so we can take pictures of the damage to create an estimate. After we create an estimate, we can start repairing your vehicle. After the repairs are complete, you'll be back on the road."
    },
    {
        question: "What is an estimate?",
        answer: "An estimate is a written report of how much damage your vehicle has sustained, and what needs to be repaired to make it safe to drive again. We can create these in-house or your insurance provider will make one for us."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a supplement?",
        answer: "A supplement is an additional estimate for any damage that has been found after taking a closer look at your vehicle. Often times damage will be hidden by parts on the outside of the vehicle, and once those parts are removed we can see if any additional internal damage needs to be repaired. We create a supplement and submit it to your insurance provider for approval, after which we can purchase parts and repair the damage."
    },
    {
        question: "How long will it take to repair my vehicle?",
        answer: "This varies based on our current schedule of repairs, as well as how much damage your vehicle has sustained. Typically repairs take anywhere from one to four weeks, but this time frame is not guranteed. Contact us if you need any help or would like an update on your vehicle's repairs."
